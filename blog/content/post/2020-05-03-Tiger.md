The Tiger Compiler project is a C++ implementation of a Tiger compiler.

The Tiger language is described by [Andrew Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/) in his [Modern Compiler Implementation](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/) books, and constitutes an important project in the [EPITA](/archive?tag=EPITA) curriculum.
