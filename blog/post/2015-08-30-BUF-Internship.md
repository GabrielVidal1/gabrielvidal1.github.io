This was a 2 weeks internship where I learned the basics of visual effects making, the workflow and managed to create my first 3D renders myself.

## Buf Compagnie

Founded in 1984, [BUF](https://buf.com/) has established itself as an industry leader in visual effects in Europe. As one of the few pioneers of computer-generated images, BUF has been blazing new trails for over 30 years providing stunning visual effects for more than 80 films and 1000 commercials.
### Bsuite

They develop their own software for all the steps of the workflow. More information on the Bsuite [here](https://bufsoftware.com/products/bsuite/).

A complete 3D pipeline studio from modeling, dynamics, animation to high end rendering, a node-based compositing software, a batch process manager and many moreâ€¦

#### Bstudio

I mainly used **Bstudio** during this internship as its the main software from 3D modeling to rendering (so accessible enough without having to learn a ton of concepts at one).


## Dominos simulation

My first exercise was to make a system to place 3D dominos along a curve. I made two renders with this basic system, first along a spiral and then with dominos varying in size.

I also made a script to place dominos in a triangular shape and made a big metal ball fall onto them.

## Destructible objects

I also deigned a system to break 3D object in small pieces using a Voronoi noise by sampling points in a model, moving their position a little with noise, and cutting the object in multiple pieces (each with their own rigidbody). When the object is touched, the object is destroyed!

I also experimented more in depth with procedural materials for the debris.

## Liquid simulation

I tried to make a liquid simulation but didn't manage to get the settings quite right.
