An auto battler, also known as auto chess, is a sub genre of strategy video games that features chess-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player.

Your main goal is to design the most efficient and strong configuration to battle against a diverse pool of enemies and even your classmates, thus becoming the best trainer!
