> You incarnate a balloon and try to survive in a deadly desert !

I made this game for the [2017 Game Maker's Toolkit Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam).

The theme was [Downwell's Dual Purpose Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5C1Uj7jJCg).

> This video is all about how everything in the indie game **Downwell** serves at least two purposes. Your jump button is your shoot button, shooting also helps you maneuver yourself, jumping on enemies starts a combo meter, and more.
>
> Here’s another example of dual purpose design: In **Hyper Light Drifter**, you reload your gun by slashing enemies with your sword, which forces you into close-quarters combat. In **Doom**, the glory kill doesn’t just kill enemies, but also showers you with health, encouraging a more aggressive style of play. In **Splatoon**, shooting ink kills enemies, takes territory, and creates pathways. Swimming in ink is used to travel faster, climb up walls, sneak past enemies, and reload your weapon. It’s genius!
>
> It’s all about doing more with less, and we want to see games where actions, enemies, rules, level elements, and/or buttons do multiple things - and see what fun and interesting gameplay scenarios can come from that.

## The Game

My idea was having only one button to move around, and to do that I decided to make the player a balloon that can breath out air to push itself around.

In this game, you control the flux of air of a balloon: When you press the space bar, the balloon deflate and push yourself in the opposite direction of your blast of air. Your 'trumpet' self-orient itself in the direction of the closest beacon. Try to move to the end of each level, with different mechanics and objects!

The player has a limited amount of air inside the balloon and can resplenish its air by going above air vents!
