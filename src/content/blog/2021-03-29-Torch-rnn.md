description: A shell script to make Torch-rnn easier to use
---

Not long ago I downloaded all the Messenger discussions I had with a friend. There were around 10,000 messages and I tough it would be fun to train an AI to learn these discussions, our way to write messages, and come up with discussions on its own.

To do that I use the [Torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn) which is model of recurrent neural network designed to learn text. It's base on [Char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)

I developed a shell script to improve my workflow and make this wonderful tool more accessible.
