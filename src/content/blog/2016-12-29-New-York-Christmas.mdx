I made this game for the [Christmas GameJam 2016](https://itch.io/jam/xmas2016). My idea was to make a platformer game on the roofs of New york and the player can use _icycles_ (like icy tentacles) to make bridges across the drops to move around buildings.

The _icycles_ are procedurally generated and can break under the player's weight.

## The Lore

_Bad luck for Santa Claus on this Christmas Eve : his sleigh is broken and his reindeers are on strike! He needs now to deliver presents to all the New York City children..._

_You will have to jump from roof to roof, gather scattered presents to feed the targeted chimney with the help of a secret weapon... **Icy Tentacles**!_

_Discover the 10 first levels of this frozen Christmas night !_

## Controls

- **Move** : W A S D
- **Look around** : Mouse
- **Interact** : E
- **Grow an icy tentacle** : Left Click
