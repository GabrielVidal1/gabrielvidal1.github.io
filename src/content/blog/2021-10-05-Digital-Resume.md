description: New Resume website made with NuxtJS
---

I wanted to remake my resume and why not test a new web front framework.

I made this website with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

You can check it out [here](https://gabrielvidal1.github.io/resume) or by clicking the **'Resume'** button in the navbar :)
