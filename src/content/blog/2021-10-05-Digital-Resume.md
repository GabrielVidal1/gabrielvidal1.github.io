## Original post from 2021-10-05

I wanted to remake my resume and why not test a new web front framework.

I made this website with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

You can check it out [here](https://resume.gabriel.vidal--ayrinhac.xyz/) or by clicking the **'Resume'** button in the navbar :)

# New Resume

When I tried to update this project, I was quickly bored by the debugging I had to do when trying to upgrade the dependencies. So I decided to remake it with NextJS, so I can use React and Typescript, which I'm very familiar with.

I also decided to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host it. It's a really great platform that allows you to host your website for free and with a really simple setup. No need to setup Github Actions or anything, just push your code and it's live. The domain buying and setup was surprisingly easy compared to Gandi that I used for previous projects.

I added more feature, for example now you can filter projects by category and tags. I also added a dark mode that gets the job done (not very proud of it lol).
