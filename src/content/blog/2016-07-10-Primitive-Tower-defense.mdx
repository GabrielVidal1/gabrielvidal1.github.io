In 2016, I did [Isart Digital Summer camps](https://www.isart.com/summer-camps/video-game-creation/) to learn to create video games on [Unity](https://unity.com/).
This camp gave me an introduction to creating video games. I discovered how to set up the rules (Gameplay), to create levels (Level Design) and to integrate the interactions of a game (Programming).

During this week I experimented with a lot of things in Unity, and by the end of the week, I managed to make a full game call Primitive Tower Defense. It's a very basic tower defense game, with waves of enemies and towers you can place to kill them.
Given I made this game in a week, I decided to submit it to the [My First Game Jam: Summer Edition](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2016). You can see my submission [here](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2016/rate/75019).
