description: Prototype of an application offering guided tours to tourists.

Application offering guided tours to tourists. Users may answer a short questionnaire (or search parameters) asking for their budget, the type of activity they are interested in (sports, cultural, relaxation), and the duration of their stay.

Project made during my computer science engineering degree at EPITA, in the context of a Design Thinking course.

## Features

- Display prices in a detailed manner (total plus each activity).
- Maintain a history of user travels.
- Option to bookmark favorite tours.
- Save user preferences (activity type, dining, accommodation).
- Personalization of tours (click on an activity to have the site suggest others while keeping the rest of the itinerary). Even customize as the journey progresses.
- Display the ecological impact of each activity (prioritising activities that pollute less).
- Highlight local activities and businesses.

## Application Organization

- **Login Page** (possibility to search without logging in).
- **Homepage**: Trip search with various parameters that cannot be asked during initial setup.

For the search, users could respond to a questionnaire by selecting options or images, with the questionnaire being personalized based on the destination.

- **Results Page**: Feed with blocks containing key information.
