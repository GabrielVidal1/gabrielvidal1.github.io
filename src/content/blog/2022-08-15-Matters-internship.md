description: My end-of-studies internship at Matters, a startup studio working for clients to make the world a better place, as a fullstack & devops web developer.

As a part of my computer science engineer degree at Epita, I had to integrate a company to prove I’m worthy of becoming an engineer. When I started my major SIGL, I didn’t know at all what I wanted to do after my degree. I had quite some experiences as a freelance web developer for one year, but I wasn’t sure that I would want to code my whole life.

As my SIGL curriculum started to come to an end, I had to search for an end of studies internship. First I searched in the fields that matter to me: mobility, healthcare, education and ecology but didn’t find the right fit. I received a lot of offers, from a lot of different companies, but none of them seem to work in a field that matters to me or with enough technical challenge. That is until I had my first interview with Matters. They had everything none of the others had: a startup studio working for clients to make the world a better place, with a good amount of technical challenge, sign me in!

## Matters

So I joined [Matters](https://matters.tech/) for 6 months beginning in February 2022. We were 5 interns joining at the same time, and started by an onboarding project that consisted of coding a clone of the social network Twitter. This project was using the same technical stack as the real projects, so we could become familiar with it, and all the processes and good practices. After this starter project, I was ready to join a team and work on a real one.

In the next part, I’m going to present the two main skills I used the most, and I find them to be the most important in the business world: **rigor and adaptability**. They might seem incompatible, but trust me they can be combined to make yourself a true engineer.

### Cali

After the onboarding project, I worked on my first real project : [Cali](https://www.cali-rse.com/) (Corporate Awareness to Limit Impact). It’s a web application to help companies define, measure and improve their corporate social responsibility, through indicators that measure specific metrics, like the amount of fuel or electricity consumed over time. The website proposes actions that act on indicators through quizzes or tips. The business core was new to me, and the frameworks were too, and I was still learning Matters’ processes. To be able to keep up with the work assigned to me, I had to learn at a very fast pace and apply methods with great rigor. As I became more and more used to the different parts of the project, I was assigned bigger and more complex tasks. First I was struggling, but I adapted the methods taught to improve my workflow and overcome the workload. At the end of my time on **Cali**, I had developed a well-defined process to work efficiently on multiple features at the same time, thus increasing my speed, autonomy and overall quality of work.

### Skeleton

I worked a week on the skeleton, the template project which most projects start from. It contains everything you need: authentification, database, frontend and backend. I had already backported improvements I did on Cali to the skeleton, but now I was working on the migration of Yarn to its version 3. Then I joined the [Kryptview](https://kryptview.com/) team, to work on the eponymous project.

### Kryptview

**Kryptview** is a Research-to-earn platform where users can submit fundamental research they make on crypto tokens, others can review them and all can earn KVTs, which is the crypto token put in place by the project to reward users for their participation. The website had a private Alpha just before I joined, so there was plenty of feedback for new and existing features to address.

Even though Cali and Kryptview use the same technical stack, the business core is totally different. I used all the base technical knowledge I gathered on Cali to understand the business and its stakes. During the first few days, I was able to adapt to the new codebase, and implement features just as fast as I did on Cali. I continued to improve my general workflow, adapting it to my new team, and I would say it worked!

### Access V2

I had the opportunity to work on the skeleton and Kryptview because the initial project I was staffed for wasn’t ready yet. 4 weeks later, it was. This last project is Access V2, for the legal consulting firm Beau de Loménie, which specializes in intellectual property. Access V2 is a remake of Access V1, an old project developed by Matters and operational since 2014. Some breaking changes made to the backend application, external to Matters, will make it obsolete in December of this year, so Access V2 needs to be ready by then.

The core business is (again) new to me, but this time the project just started so no codebase to learn from. It was really challenging at first, because the core business implied a lot of constraints, mainly security practices and a lot legacy technologies: the Oracle database is incompatible with the usual stack at Matters, protected behind a VPN, and no documentation was provided to us from the Access V1 team, with only one developer still at Matters.

We had to put processes in place to increase visibility, mainly for the client, but also to identify as soon as possible the risks that could make a feature take forever to implement. Rigor again became a key capability to keep the project afloat. I still have a month to work on this project, and since I accepted the offer to stay, I will continue on it in September.

## Conclusion

As mentioned in the introduction, the ability to follow strict rules and to adapt them when working in a new environment is the key to success for me. That is why I developed a workflow that can be adapted to any feature of any size, with checkpoints to improve visibility of the work being done and its status, while maximizing autonomy via asynchronous communication with my team. Matters strengthened my belief that web development is currently the best way to make any idea possible and get the most impact from it.

In the end, I would say that I was really lucky to work on such different projects, from corporate awareness, to intellectual property, passing by crypto tokens, it was a wild ride! Who knows what Matters got for me in the future…
