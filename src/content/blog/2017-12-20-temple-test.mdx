To test my [first prototype](/GrenGame/First-Prototype) of growing plants, I wanted to have a temple I could cover in plants, so I created... **the TEMPLE!**
I don't have any 3D skills so I just used cubes of different colors inside Unity to create a big structure.

### BEHOLD... THE TEMPLE

<div class="figure">
  <figure>
    <img
      style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px black;"
      src="/assets/projects/GrenGame/temple/Temple_Before.PNG"
    />
  </figure>
</div>

### First attacks

I first used a default green color for the plants and only changed their width.

<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--12 cell--lg-6 figure">
    <figure>
      <img src="/assets/projects/GrenGame/temple/Temple_After.PNG" />
      <figcaption>Really big beanstalks are attacking the temple!!</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="cell cell--12 cell--lg-6 figure">
    <figure>
      <img src="/assets/projects/GrenGame/temple/Temple_After2.PNG" />
      <figcaption>Oh no!! Now vines are covering the temple!...</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

### Material experimentation

I wanted to experiment different materials for the plants so here is a few of numerous tests I made:

<Carousel
  client:visible
  data={new Array(10).fill(0).map((_, i) => ({
    image: `/assets/projects/GrenGame/temple/Attack${i + 1}.PNG`,
  }))}
/>

### Different plants

With the tools I created, I was able to make important variations in the shape, length, girth and noise of the plants, that can completely change the type of plant (in a single color for now).

<Carousel
  client:visible
  data={[1, 2, 3].map((i) => ({
    image: `/assets/projects/GrenGame/temple/test${i}.png`,
  }))}
/>
