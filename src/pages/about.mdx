I am Gabriel Vidal-Ayrinhac, a 23-year-old full-stack engineer currently working at Matters, a Parisian startup studio. ðŸš€ Passionate about science and video games since my childhood, I have developed my own games and <a href="https://gabrielvidal.itch.io/">participated in numerous Game Jams</a>. ðŸŽ®

I gained experience as a junior developer at BUF Compagnie, working on visual effects software for cinema, and at France IOI, contributing to an online learning platform for algorithmics. ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’»

I also pursued a curriculum at EPITA, where I strengthened my computer science and software engineering skills while working on team projects. ðŸŽ“

Astounded by the potential of AI, particularly in image generation, I would like to combine my technical expertise with my artistic aspirations by taking part in the AI revolution and contributing to the democratization of art through image generation. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
