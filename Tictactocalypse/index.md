Tictactocalypse is a funnier, realtime and apocalyptic version of the game TicTac-Toe. Players battle to place pieces on a board, and trigger events in order to disrupt others! Play up to four players at the same time!

I made this game as a game design project for the game design class I took for one semester at [Cal State Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/).

The project was made in 3 weeks with the following game design documents to produce:

* #### A **[rulesheet](/Tictactocalypse/Rulesheet.html)**, which describes all that the player need to know in order to play the game (the goal of the game, the inputs, the events)

* #### A **[MDA](/Tictactocalypse/MDA.html)** (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) to analyse the game mechanics, the dynamics created by the player with those mechanics and the feelings that the game induce

* #### A **[final reflection](/Tictactocalypse/FinalReflection.html)** on the project, reflection on the game and its different iterations and the difference from the first prototype
